What is a Node?
- A Node repercents physical hardware running Pyrodactyl Elytra (or ptrodactyl wings) Daemon that hosts servers in containers. Nodes defeine resource pools for CPU, Memory, Disk Space, IPs and ports


Node vs Location vs Server
- Location: Grouping label (region/provider).
- Node: Machine + daemon + resource/allocation pool; belongs to one Location.
- Server: User container consuming a slice of a Node’s resources and allocations.
- Don’t create a Node just to group servers—use naming/filters. (if you must you can use locations for that eg bedwars.provider)

When to Create a Node
- When you have a new hardware (VPS or Dedicated) that you want to use to host more servers.
- You split one dedicated server into many Virual ones (via proxmox or other hypervisor)

Prerequisites
- Domain name (optional but required for SSL/TLS)
- Daemon reachable (firewall open).
- FQDN or IP ready (SSL/reverse proxy decided).
- SFTP/Docker dependencies installed as needed.

## Terminology
- Servers: The game server you are wanting to run IE Minecraft, TF2
- VPS/Dedicated: The hardware that is being used to host the game servers
- Nodes: Internal name to describe/speficy what hardware you are using
- Location: The location made in the panel to seperate where the nodes are physically hosted


Creating a Node
1. Admin Area > Nodes > Create Node.
2. Fill fields, Save.
3. Add at least one IP/Port allocation.
4. Assign or create servers for this Node.

Core Fields
- General: Name, Description, Location.
- Connectivity: FQDN/IP, Public Port (daemon, e.g., 8080), SFTP Port (e.g., 2022); open firewall.
- Resource Limits (totals for the Node): Total Memory/Disk/CPU; Over-Allocate % for memory/disk/CPU.
- Allocation/Ports: Default IP, additional IPs, add port ranges, remove unused ports.
- Daemon Config: Base Path (e.g., /var/lib/pyrodactyl/servers), Behind Proxy, Maintenance Mode, Backup dir/limits.
- Security/Limits: Upload size, allowed archive extensions, default Docker images list, reject stale daemon versions.
- Advanced: Task timeout/graceful stop, container network mode, disk check strategy.

## Editing a Node

- Safe: Description, over-allocation, add IPs/ports, Docker image list, upload limits, Maintenance toggle.
- Caution: FQDN/IP, Public/SFTP ports (needs DNS/firewall/service restart), Base Path (requires data migration).

## Renaming

- No runtime impact; may break external automation—audit scripts first.

## Resource Strategy

- Memory/Disk: Reflect usable capacity minus OS; use modest over-allocation.
- CPU: Sum server CPU limits should respect Total CPU plus over-allocate margin. Over-allocate lightly for bursty workloads (25–50%); avoid for consistently high usage.

## Allocation Management

- Workflow: Add IPs -> add port ranges -> servers consume ports -> remove unused.
- Best practices: Keep 10–15% port buffer; group port ranges by game type; add aliases for multi-provider/NAT.

## Deleting a Node

- Move or delete all servers first, then clear allocations, then delete. No auto-migration.

## Migration (High-Level)

- Create new Node -> ensure parity -> stop server -> transfer files (rsync/backup) -> recreate on new Node -> validate -> clean old allocations.

## Monitoring & Health

- Watch daemon heartbeat, free allocations, over-allocation pressure (>90% phys), disk inodes, Docker image updates.

## Common Mistakes (and fixes)
- Total Memory set to full RAM -> OOM risk -> reserve 5–15% for OS.
- Excessive over-allocation (e.g., 200%) -> performance issues -> lower ratio.
- Missing firewall rules for daemon/SFTP -> offline/errors -> open/persist rules.
- Mixing prod/test on same Node -> contention -> separate or limit.
- Deleting IP before clearing allocations -> stale errors -> remove allocations first.
- Skipping Maintenance before major changes -> disruptions -> enable Maintenance.
- Changing Base Path carelessly -> broken paths -> plan migration/symlinks.

## Best Practices

- Consistent naming (e.g., node-us-nyc-1); put hardware class in description.
- Maintain capacity sheet (total vs allocated).
- Prune unused ports; curate minimal Docker images.
- Use Maintenance Mode for daemon/kernel upgrades.

## API Notes
- Admin API: create/list Nodes, manage allocations, update limits, toggle maintenance.
- Typical flow: POST Location -> POST Node -> POST allocations -> POST servers (Node ID). Validate daemon connection.

When to Add Another Node
- New machine, sustained capacity >80% memory, isolation needs, different performance tiers.
- Don’t add for just a new server or a different Docker image.

Quick Checklist
- Daemon reachable; DNS/SSL/proxy correct; firewall open (daemon/SFTP).
- Resource totals set minus OS; intentional over-allocation.
- IPs and adequate port pool added.
- Docker images curated; monitoring/logs; backup strategy in place.

## Quick Checklist

- Daemon reachable; DNS/SSL/proxy correct; firewall open (daemon/SFTP).
- Resource totals set minus OS; intentional over-allocation.
- IPs and adequate port pool added.
- Docker images curated; monitoring/logs; backup strategy in place.

## Capacity Review Tips

- Memory: alert 75%, plan 85%.
- Disk: alert 70%, plan 80%, emergency 90%.
- Ports: alert when <10% free.
- CPU: check sustained 15m load vs cores.

## Troubleshooting
- Node offline: check daemon service, TLS/proxy, connectivity (nc/curl).
- Can’t allocate ports: pool exhausted, IP missing, port in use/firewalled.
- Start fails (insufficient resources): over-allocation exceeded -> adjust or migrate.

## Glossary

- Allocation: Reserved IP:Port.
- Over-Allocate: Oversubscribe beyond physical.
- Daemon: Background container manager.
- Maintenance Mode: Block new actions; running servers continue.

## Example Naming

- node-us-east-1, node-eu-fra-2, node-ap-sgp-1, node-edge-la-1, node-aws-usw-1, us.chicago.pyro.

## Scaling

- Vertical: increase Node resources (after hardware upgrade).
- Horizontal: add another Node in same Location.
- Geographic: new Location + Node.
