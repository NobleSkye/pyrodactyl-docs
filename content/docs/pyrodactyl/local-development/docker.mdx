This approach offers several advantages compared to [Vagrant](vagrant):

- Faster boot and initial setup times
- Easy viewing & resetting of server data
- Lower resource consumption
- Easy service management & viewing of logs

## Prerequisites

- Latest version of NodeJS LTS
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm@latest`)
- Git
- Docker Engine
  - On Linux, see your distro's wiki or [Docker's docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for setting up Docker alongside its services
  - On macOS, [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) is recommended to provide Docker Engine, but [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) can be used instead
- `buildx` and `compose` Docker extensions
  - These are installed by default with OrbStack and Docker Desktop

## Limitations

- To delete or modify server data on Linux, you'll need to use `sudo` as Docker creates the volume binds as root
  - You can use rootless Docker to workaround this
- If you move the repositories location, you'll need to [reset the server data](#resetting-server-data) as paths are hardcoded in the container

## Initial setup

1. Clone the Pyrodactyl panel repository

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   pnpm run ship
   ```

   - Caches build results
   - Uploads sourcemaps to Sentry
   - Makes subsequent builds without code changes nearly instant

1. Initialize the Docker image: `pnpm build:docker:dev`

   - Installs PHP and system dependencies
   - Configures the image for Pyrodactyl services
   - This only needs to be done once unless PHP dependencies or the `Dockerfile` changes

1. Copy the `docker-compose.develop.yml` file to `docker-compose.yml`, and adjust it carefully if needed

1. Move onto general usage

## General usage

Once you've completed the initial setup:

1. Run `pnpm compose` to startup the environment. If this is your first time running this, it'll take a second to pull and configure everything

1. Run `pnpm dev:docker` to start a local development server

   - For a production preview, run `pnpm run ship` and its build will be hosted by Docker

1. Access Pyrodactyl from http://localhost:3000/, and login using the default credentials of `dev@pyro.host` and `password`

1. Once finished, you can stop Docker using `pnpm compose:down`

## Tips

### Remote caching

Set up Remote Caching via Turbo for faster builds. Cached results allow production server builds to complete in milliseconds.

### Database host

This method supports creating a database host out of the box, which allows you to create databases on servers for testing. To do this, navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin/databases, click **Create New**, and use the following settings:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```yaml
Name: db                      # you can name it anything
Host: database                # the name of the database service in Docker
Port: 3306                    # leave it at default
Username: pterodactyluser
Password: somepassword
Linked node: local
```

## Resetting server data

To **irreversibly** reset your Docker data:

1. Take the Docker compose down (`pnpm compose:down`)

1. Enter the following command in your terminal (`sudo` is only required on Linux):

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf var vendor .env srv
   ```

1. Put the Docker compose back up again (`pnpm compose`) and server data should be recreated

## Troubleshooting

Make sure you're not running into any [known limitations](#limitations).

### General errors

Firstly, try the below:

1. Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` is correct. You should've copied the example `docker-compose.develop.yml` to this file
1. [Reset your server data](#resetting-server-data) if your happy to do so
1. Rebuild the Docker image (`pnpm build:docker:dev`)

If nothing above works, collect any errors from the following to aid in troubleshooting:

- The latest Laravel logs inside `./srv/logs`
- The logs of the services (i.e. panel, Wings, database)

You can try searching these errors in the [Pterodactyl Discord server](https://discord.gg/pterodactyl) as someone has likely already found a solution. **However, DO NOT ask for support in the Pterodactyl Discord** as they do not support Pyrodactyl and _will not_ help you.

If you need to ask for help, ask in our [Pyrodactyl Discord server](https://discord.gg/FGWKZT5dxv).

### Ports in use

Try killing any processes that could be using Pyrodactyl's ports, i.e. 8080, 2022, and 3000 by default, then run `pnpm compose` again. However, if that won't work, try the below:

1. If the issue is while starting a server, adjust the allocations in your node settings to other ports
1. If the issue is while starting the compose, carefully adjust the `docker-compose.yml`'s IP settings
