</Callout>

Good news! We're building a simple installation script that will guide you through the entire setup process. The script will handle all the technical details while providing clear, step-by-step instructions along the way.

### What to Expect
- **Guided Setup**: Clear instructions at each step
- **Automated Configuration**: Script handles technical details automatically
- **Error Handling**: Built-in checks and troubleshooting
- **Simple Requirements**: Just paste and run the script

We want everyone to be able to run their own game servers, whether you're tech-savvy or not. Our installation script will make setting up Pyrodactyl straightforward and hassle-free!
