## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Docker)

<Callout type="warn">
  Always make sure you take a backup of your Pterodactyl database and other relevant data.
</Callout>

If you already have Pterodactyl running in Docker, simply update your panel image in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```diff
-image: ghcr.io/pterodactyl/panel:latest
+image: ghcr.io/pyrohost/pyrodactyl:main
```

<Callout type="error">
  Moving from Pyrodactyl to Pterodactyl is unsupported and can cause data loss. Pyrodactyl makes changes to the database schema, making it unlikely Pterodactyl will function correctly. If you care about the validity of your database, **make a backup** before swapping back to Pterodactyl.
</Callout>
