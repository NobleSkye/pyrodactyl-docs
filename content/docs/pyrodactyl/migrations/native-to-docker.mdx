## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Native â†’ Docker)

### Prerequisites

- Linux system with root access
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Docker expertise and basic system administration skills
- Consider [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install) for easier Docker management
- Avoid using Snap-based Docker installations on Ubuntu
- Enable Docker auto-start on boot

### Pyrodactyl Installation

1. Create a new folder (e.g. `pyrodactyl-panel`) on your server in a safe location, and switch to it.
1. Download and configure the [docker-compose.example.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/main/docker-compose.example.yml)
1. Modify placeholder variables under `x-common`
1. If you are using built-in HTTPS, add port 443 (to the `ports` section under the `panel` container) and set the `LE_EMAIL` variable (in the `panel` section under `x-common`) to a registered Let's Encrypt email address.
1. Copy the following environment variables from your Pterodactyl `.env` to your `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```bash
   APP_KEY
   APP_URL
   DB_CONNECTION
   DB_HOST
   DB_PORT
   DB_DATABASE
   DB_USERNAME
   DB_PASSWORD
   HASHIDS_SALT
   HASHIDS_LENGTH # (if it's not 8)
   ```

   The following are only applicable if email is set up:

   ```bash
   MAIL_MAILER
   MAIL_HOST
   MAIL_PORT
   MAIL_USERNAME
   MAIL_PASSWORD
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
   MAIL_FROM_NAME
   APP_SERVICE_AUTHOR
   MAIL_DRIVER
   ```

1. If your database is running on the same machine as your panel, set it to listen on the IP `172.17.0.1`, and change the `DB_HOST` environment variable to `172.17.0.1`.
1. Rename `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`
1. Run the following command to start the panel:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Your panel is now running! You can access it at the same URL as before, and use the same user accounts.
